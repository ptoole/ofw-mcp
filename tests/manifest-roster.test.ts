/**
 * `manifest.json`'s tool roster must equal the REGISTERED roster, both ways.
 *
 * This is the file an mcpb host reads to decide what to show. A tool missing
 * from it is callable by name and invisible in the UI; a tool listed but not
 * registered is advertised and then fails. Neither breaks a test, breaks the
 * build, or breaks the server — nothing else in this repo reads the file — so
 * the drift is silent in both directions and only a user notices.
 *
 * It had drifted: `ofw_check_freshness` and `ofw_status` were registered and
 * absent from the manifest. `ofw_status` is the call the whole "verify rather
 * than recite" design rests on (see CLAUDE.md), so it was exactly the wrong
 * one to hide.
 *
 * The roster is read by REGISTERING, not by scanning source. A grep for
 * `registerTool('name'` misses a name on a continuation line, a name that is a
 * loop variable, and a tool registered through a shared helper — all three
 * occur across this fleet.
